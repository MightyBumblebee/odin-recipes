<ul class="no-bullets">
    <li><strong>Prep: </strong> 15 mins</li>
    <li><strong>Cook: </strong> 50 mins</li>
    <li><strong>Serves: </strong> 4</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
    <li>1 butternut squash, about 1kg, peeled and deseeded</li>
    <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
    <li>2 onions, diced</li>
    <li>1 garlic clove, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>2 mild red chillies, deseeded and finely chopped</li>
    <li>850ml hot vegetable stock</li>
    <li>4 tbsp crème fraîche, plus more to serve</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6.</li>
    <li>Cut the squash into large cubes, about 4cm/1½in across, then toss in a large roasting tin with 1 tbsp of the olive oil.</li>
    <li>Roast for 30 mins, turning once during cooking, until golden and soft.</li>
    <li>While the butternut squash cooks, melt the butter with the remaining 1 tbsp olive oil in a large saucepan, then add the onions, garlic clove and three-quarters of the chillies.</li>
    <li>Cover and cook on a very low heat for 15-20 mins until the onions are completely soft.</li>
    <li>Tip the butternut squash into the pan, add the stock and crème fraîche, then whizz with a stick blender until smooth. For a really silky soup, put the soup into a liquidiser and blitz it in batches.</li>
    <li>Return to the pan, gently reheat, then season to taste. Serve the soup in bowls with swirls of crème fraîche and a scattering of the remaining chopped chilli.</li>
</ol>
